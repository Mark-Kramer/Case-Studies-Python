    "**A.** We note that the units of the power spectral density (variable `Sxx`) are mV$^2/$Hz, while the units of the power estimated in variable `Sxx_model_60Hz` are mV$^2$. To convert the power spectral density to (integrated) spectral power, we must integrate the variable `Sxx` over a frequency range. Here, we choose a 1 Hz interval centered at 60 Hz, which corresponds to a single index of the variable `faxis`; the frequency resolution for these data is $\\pm 0.5$ Hz. Then the approximate integrated power over this 1 Hz interval can be computed as `Sxx[np.where(faxis == 60)]`, which equals 0.9978, identical to the value in `Sxx_model_60Hz`, and with the same units.\n",

    "This example, in which we focused on the 60 Hz activity in the EEG, illustrates how we may use multiple linear regression to estimate the power. We could extend this procedure to include additional rhythms in the model beyond 60 Hz (e.g., sine and cosine functions at 1 Hz, 2 Hz, 3 Hz, etc.). In doing so, we would add more terms to the multiple linear regression model and have more $\\beta$'s to determine from the data. Multiple linear regression provides a way to decompose the EEG data into sine and cosine functions at different frequencies—just as we proposed to do using the Fourier transform—and then compute the power at each frequency. Using either multiple linear regression or the Fourier transform, we aim to decompose the EEG into sine and cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies."
