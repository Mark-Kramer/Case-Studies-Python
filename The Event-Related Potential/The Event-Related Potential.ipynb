    "Voltage recordings from the scalp surface - the electroencephalogram or EEG - provide a powerful window into brain voltage activity.  Some of the earliest human EEG recording occurred in 1924, when Dr. Hans Berger made a remarkable discovery:  the EEG of a human subject at rest with eyes closed exhibits rhythmic activity, an approximately 10 Hz oscillation he labeled the alpha rhythm.  Although now studied for nearly 100 years, the definitive functional role (if any) of the alpha rhythm remains unknown.  Since then, many other EEG rhythms have been detected and labelled (typically with Greek letters) and the analysis of EEG rhythms remains an active area of research. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other modalities for measuring brain activity, the EEG possesses both advantages and disadvantages.  Perhaps the most important advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The EEG is non-invasive, and\n",
    "2. The EEG permits a high temporal resolution (on the order of milliseconds).\n",
    "But, the EEG measure also suffers from significant disadvantages, the most devastating being the poor spatial resolution;  a single scalp electrode detects the summed activity from approximately 10 cm<sup>2</sup> of cortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we consider EEG data recorded from a single scalp electrode.  We will analyze these data to determine what (if any) activity is evoked following two different types of stimuli presented to a human subject.  In doing so, we will continue to develop our skills in MATLAB, and begin to see how this powerful tool can help us understand these time series data.  We begin with a brief description of the EEG data."

    "## Case Study: an EEG ERP task\n",
    "An undergraduate student volunteers to participate in a psychology study at his university. In this study, EEG electrodes (sampling rate 500 Hz, i.e., 500 samples per second) are placed on the student's scalp, and he is seated in a comfortable chair in a dark, electrically isolated room.  The student is instructed to place headphones over his ears and listen to a series of repeated sounds.  The sounds consist of two tones - either a high pitch tone or a low pitch tone.  A single tone is presented once every few seconds, and the student responds with a button press to the low pitch tone.  The tone presentation is repeated to collect the EEG response to numerous presentations of the two tones, as illustrated here:\n",

    "In this cartoon illustration of the EEG experiment, the EEG electrodes are placed on the scalp surface of a human subject (left).  The EEG activity (blue) is recorded as a function of time during presentation of high pitch tones (black) and low pitch tones (orange).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our collaborator leading this research study has agreed to provide us with EEG data recorded at a single electrode for 1000 presentations of the high pitch tone, and 1000 presentations of the low pitch tone.  In each presentation - or \"trial\" - she provides us with 1 s of EEG data, such that the tone occurs at 0.25 s into the trial.  She asks us to analyze these data to determine whether the EEG signal differs following the two tone presentations."
