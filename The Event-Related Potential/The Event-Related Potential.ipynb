    "Voltage recordings from the scalp surface - the electroencephalogram or EEG - provide a powerful window into brain voltage activity.  Some of the earliest human EEG recording occurred in 1924, when [Dr. Hans Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Berger) made a remarkable discovery:  the EEG of a human subject at rest with eyes closed exhibits rhythmic activity, an approximately 10 Hz oscillation he labeled the alpha rhythm.  Although now studied for nearly 100 years, the definitive functional role (if any) of the alpha rhythm remains unknown.  Since then, many other EEG rhythms have been detected and labelled (typically with Greek letters) and the analysis of EEG rhythms remains [an active area of research](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/rhythms-of-the-brain-9780199828234). \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other modalities for measuring brain activity, the EEG possesses both advantages and disadvantages.  Perhaps the most important advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The EEG is non-invasive, and\n",
    "2. The EEG permits a high temporal resolution (on the order of milliseconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the EEG measure also suffers from significant disadvantages, the most devastating being the poor spatial resolution;  a single scalp electrode detects the summed activity from approximately 10 cm<sup>2</sup> of cortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we consider EEG data recorded from a single scalp electrode.  We will analyze these data to determine what (if any) activity is evoked following two different types of stimuli presented to a human subject.  In doing so, we will use Python, and see how this powerful tool can help us understand these time series data.  We begin with a brief description of the EEG data."

In this study, EEG electrodes (sampling rate 500 Hz, i.e., 500 samples per second) are placed on the student's scalp, and he is seated in a comfortable chair in a dark, electrically isolated room.  The student is instructed to place headphones over his ears and listen to a series of repeated sounds.  The sounds consist of two tones - either a high pitch tone or a low pitch tone.  A single tone is presented once every few seconds, and the student responds with a button press to the low pitch tone.

Briefly, this theorem states that the mean of a sufficiently large number of independent random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will be approximately [normally distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). Remember that the ERP at each moment in time is the sum of EEG activity across trials (then scaled by a constant, the number of trials).

    "So far we have computed confidence intervals for the ERPs by relying on the central limit theorem and approximating the average voltage values at each point in time as normally distributed. That’s a completely reasonable approach. And because the normal distribution is so well-behaved, it’s easy to compute the 95% confidence intervals. An alternative approach to generate confidence intervals is through a **bootstrap** procedure. Bootstrapping is a resampling method that allows us to estimate the sampling distribution of many different statistics. In this chapter, we implement a *nonparametric bootstrap* (see note). To do so, we generate new *pseudodata* from the observed EEG data. We begin by using a bootstrapping procedure to create confidence intervals for the ERPs observed in each condition."

The fundamental idea is that resampling the data with replacement is equivalent to sampling new pseudodata from the empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) of the observed data. For a large sample of independent, identically distributed random variables, the distribution of the pseudodata generated from the eCDF will be close to the true distribution of the data. Note the important caveat that the variables are independent, identically distributed; this assumption fails in many cases, such as for time series. Here, we assume that each trial is drawn independently from the same distribution (i.e., the trials are independent, identically distributed variables).\n",

    "**A.** Yes. Under the null hypothesis, the distribution fo the statistic ranges from approximately 0.15 to 0.33. The observed statistic `stat = 0.2884` exceeds most values in this distribution. Computing `sum(statD > stat)` we find in this example that only 18 of the 3,000 values in the distribution exceed the observed statistic. This corresponds to a proportion of 18/3000 = 0.006. We therefore reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the ERPs of conditions A and B.

    "This result illustrates the power of the bootstrapping procedure. We proposed a complicated statistic (the maximum absolute value of the difference between the two resampled ERPs). For this statistic, we do not possess an obvious formula to decide whether the resulting statistic is significant (we cannot rely on the CLT, for example). To determine significance, we employ a bootstrapping procedure (also known as a permutation test), which we can perform even for the relatively complicated statistic. In this way, we may devise complicated measures of data and construct error bars or compute statistical significance, provided our computational resources are sufficient."

    "In this notebook, we considered scalp EEG data recorded from a single electrode during an auditory task. The task consisted of two conditions, and we sought to uncover the difference in the EEG responses between the two conditions. We began with a visual inspection of the EEG recordings from individual trials and from all trials, and concluded that the data were quite noisy; any evoked response due to the stimulus was not obvious in the single-trial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize the evoked signal, we computed the ERP, which involved averaging the EEG signal across trials. By doing so, we uncovered interesting structure in condition A, but not much in condition B. We then developed two techniques to add error bars to an ERP. One technique relied on the central limit theorem, and the other technique involved a computationally expensive bootstrapping procedure. Both techniques suggested that the ERP in condition A differed significantly from zero following the stimulus at time 0.25 s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we assessed whether the two ERPs from condition A and condition B differed. We did so through visual inspection, by comparing the differences in the ERPs, and by computing a statistic and assessing its significance through a bootstrapping procedure. Using the last procedure, we concluded that the ERP in the two conditions significantly differed."
